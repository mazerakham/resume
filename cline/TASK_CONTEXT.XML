      `./actual` is a copy of `./example`. We are going to
      transform it into my actual resume (it is currently a template).

      ./docs contains a useful document with information about me.
      Feel free to ask me clarifying questions if it will improve
      the resume.

    It's now rendering fine.  Just some touch-ups.

    1.  Remove Âˆ Professional Memberships: ...
    section, but keep a brief "Interests" bullet-point.
    For interests, put classical piano, chess, 
    tutoring.

    2.  The last two publications are made-up.  
    The first reference is right, and for the second
    one use ./cline/publications/... (lusin).

    3. Instead of emphasizing my tutoring in the work
    experience section, put "graduate student".  
    Include tutoring as a bullet-point.  Add a bullet-point
    that I innovated, in my Differential Equations and
    Linear Algebra lectures my last two years, publishing
    YouTube content and Mathematica-based labs allowing
    the students to get much further through the theory
    and applications than in traditionally-taught 
    undergraduate classes.  The students gave raving 
    testimonials about this.  Put a testimonials section 
    with two "lorem ipsum" testimonials that I'll fill in later.

    4.  Include a bullet point that I did 
    curriculum development for Dulwich College International's
    grade 6-9 honors curriculum as a contractor in 2018.
