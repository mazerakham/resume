      `./actual` is a copy of `./example`. We are going to
      transform it into my actual resume (it is currently a template).

      ./docs contains a useful document with information about me.
      Feel free to ask me clarifying questions if it will improve
      the resume.

    I renamed our version of the resume to

    resumes/tech_2025-04-09

    Make a sibling directory

    resumes/tech_education_2025-04-09

    which will be best suited for me to get a role at a 
    new academic institution that is looking to grow its
    mathematics and computer science programs and is looking
    for a head of department.  

    I need to emphasize my teaching experience, and talk
    significantly less about my tech experience, while 
    still mentioning it.

    Do NOT make stuff up.  If something is too bare/sparse,
    ask me for details, which I can provide in the form
    of docs.
