      `./actual` is a copy of `./example`. We are going to
      transform it into my actual resume (it is currently a template).

      ./docs contains a useful document with information about me.
      Feel free to ask me clarifying questions if it will improve
      the resume.

    Try compiling and/or rendering main.tex (I moved it to the 
    root directory) and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
